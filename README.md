# Snake Eyes Game

### A simple Snake Eyes Dice Game simulator using HTML/CSS/JS

In Snake Eyes, the term "snake eyes" refers to rolling two ones (1-1) with the dice. This is considered the lowest possible roll in the game. The name "snake eyes" comes from the appearance of the two ones, which resemble the eyes of a snake.

The game is usually played with multiple players taking turns as the shooter, who rolls the dice. The shooter begins by placing a bet on the outcome of their roll. Other players can also place bets on the shooter's roll or against it.

For this game, I have just made it so that the purpose of the game is to roll two ones and it outputs how many attempts it took for the player to get two ones.
